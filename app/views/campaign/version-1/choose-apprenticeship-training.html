					Choose apprenticeship training
				</h1>
				<p>
					There are 2 different types of apprenticeships to choose from:
				</p>
				<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/apprenticeship-standards">apprenticeship standards</a> - each standard covers a specific occupation and sets out the core skills, knowledge and behaviours an apprentice will need; they are developed by employer groups known as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-of-apprenticeships-in-england-guidance-for-trailblazers">‘trailblazers’</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-guide-to-apprenticeships">apprenticeship frameworks</a> - a series of work-related vocational and professional qualifications, with workplace- and classroom-based training
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-8">				
					To choose training for your apprenticeship:
				</h2>
				<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
					<li>
						use the ‘<a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.sfa.bis.gov.uk/">Find apprenticeship training’</a> service to select an approved apprenticeship training provider
					</li>
					<li>
						if you are using a standard, use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/register-of-apprentice-assessment-organisations">register of apprenticeship assessment organisations</a> to select an approved assessment organisation.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					If you’re a public sector body, you will need to follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-sector-procurement-policy">Public Contracts Regulation 2015</a> when selecting a training provider.
				</p>
					<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
						<li><a href="#">England</a></li>
						<li><a href="#">Scotland</a></li>
						<li><a href="#">Wales</a></li>
						<li><a href="#">Northern Ireland</a></li>
					</ul>

					<h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-8">
						I am an employer that pays the apprenticeship levy
					</h2>
					<p>
						If you pay the apprenticeship levy, you’ll receive funds to spend on training and assessing your apprentices. The government will add 10% to these funds.
					</p>
					<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pay-apprenticeship-levy" class="govuk-button govuk-button--xl">
						I pay the apprenticeship levy
					</a>

					<h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-8">
						As a levy-payer I want to transfer unused apprenticeship funds to another employer
					</h2>
					<p>
						Employers who pay the apprenticeship levy and have unused apprenticeship funds can find employers who want to receive a transfer in a number of ways, for example:
					</p>

					<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
						<li>work with employers in your supply chain</li>
						<li>get in touch with employers in your industry</li>
						<li>get in touch with an Apprenticeship Training Agency (ATA)</li>
						<li>work with regional partners</li>
					</ul>
					<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pay-apprenticeship-levy" class="govuk-button govuk-button--xl">
						I’m a levy-payer and want to transfer my unused funds to another employer
					</a>


					<h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-8">
						If you don’t need to pay the levy
					</h2>
					<p>
						You pay 10% towards the cost of training and assessing your apprentice.  The government will pay the rest (90%) up to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-funding-bands">funding band maximum</a>. They’ll pay it directly to the training organisation. 
					</p>
					<p>
						You will need to:
					</p>
					<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
						<li>
							agree a payment schedule with the training organisation
						</li>
						<li>
							pay them directly for the training
						</li>
					</ul>

					<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pay-apprenticeship-levy" class="govuk-button govuk-button--xl">
						I don’t pay the apprenticeship levy
					</a>

					<h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-8">
						Paying for your apprentices using a transfer of funds from another employer
					</h2>
					<p>
						If you’re an employer who’s received a transfer of funds from another employer, you can use these funds to pay for your apprenticeships.
					</p>
					<p>
						You will receive your funds and pay for your apprenticeships using the apprenticeship service. 
					</p>
					<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transferring-apprenticeship-service-funds" class="govuk-button govuk-button--xl">
						I’ve received funds from another employer
					</a>


					<h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-8">
						Additional payments from the government:
					</h2>
					<p>
						Additional payments of £1,000 may be available to you and your training provider at the start of an apprenticeship.  This will be paid (in 2 instalments) when you take on an apprentice who’s between:
					</p>
					<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
						<li>
							16-18 years old
						</li>
						<li>
							19-24 years old and has previously been in care or who has a local authority education, health and care plan
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						From August 2018, apprentices will receive one payment of £1000 from the government, if they have been in the care of the local authority.
