					Types of apprenticeships

				<p>
					Apprentices must work towards an <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.sfa.bis.gov.uk/">approved apprenticeship standard or framework</a>. Their training must last at least 12 months.

					Apprenticeship standards
				</h2>
				<p>
					Designed by employers, they show what an apprentice will be doing and the skills required of them, by job role. The Institute for Apprenticeships publish <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/apprenticeship-standards">apprenticeship standards</a> once they have assessed them. Employers can use apprenticeship standards once they have their allocated funding band and an approved assessment plan.
				</p>
				<p>
					To successfully complete an apprenticeship standard your apprentice will need to have an assessment plan and satisfy the requirements of an independent assessment conducted by an apprentice assessment organisation (called ‘end-point assessment’).
				</p>
				<p>
					You will agree with the apprentice assessment organisation the cost of the end-point assessment. Your training provider will contract with your chosen independent apprentice assessment organisation and pay them on your behalf.
				</p>

				<h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-4">
					Apprenticeship frameworks
				</h2>
				<p>
					These are available for delivery and cover all the statutory requirements for an apprenticeship programme in England.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no end-point assessment for this type of apprenticeship.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/removal-of-apprenticeship-frameworks">withdrawing apprenticeship frameworks</a> to move to apprenticeship standards on a phased basis as employers take on apprentices on the new standards.
