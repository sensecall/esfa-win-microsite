				How much will an apprenticeship cost me?

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
				Funding your apprentice:
			</h2>

			<p>
				You can get help from the government to pay for apprenticeship training.
			</p>
			<p>
				The amount you get depends on whether you pay the apprenticeship levy or not. You pay the levy if you’re an employer with a pay bill over £3 million each year.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additional payments of £1,000 may be available to you and your training provider at the start of an apprenticeship.  This will be paid (in 2 installments) when you take on an apprentice who’s between:
			</p>

			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>16-18 years old</li>
				<li>19-24 years old and has previously been in care or who has a local authority education, health and care plan</li>
			</ul>

			<p>From August 2018, apprentices will receive one payment of £1000 from the government, if they have been in the care of the local authority. 
			</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
				If you don’t need to pay the levy
			</h2>

			<p>
				You pay 10% towards the cost of training and assessing your apprentice. 
			</p>

			<p>
				You need to:
			</p>

			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>agree a payment schedule with the training organisation</li>
				<li>pay them directly for the training</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The government will pay the rest (90%) up to the funding band maximum. They’ll pay it directly to the training organisation.
			</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
				If you pay the apprenticeship levy
			</h2>
			<p>
				You’ll receive funds to spend on training and assessing your apprentices. The government will add 10%.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apprenticeship funding is devolved and so how you get your funds and pay for training depends on whether you’re in:
			</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>England</li>
				<li>Scotland</li>
				<li>Wales</li>
				<li>Northern Ireland</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
				Paying for your apprentices using a transfer of funds from another employer
			</h2>
			<p>
				If you’re an employer who’s received a transfer of funds from another employer, you can use these funds to pay for your apprenticeships.  
			</p>
			<p>
				You will receive your funds and pay for your apprenticeships using the apprenticeship service.
